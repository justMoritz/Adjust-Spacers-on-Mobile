# Mobile Responsive Spacers
A simple Wordpress Plugin lets you globally adjust every Wordpress Gutenberg Spacer Block to be a different size on mobile.

## Settings Page
*Breakpoint* configures the screen width in pixels when the spacers change size. This is the \"max-width\" for the mobile setting. Any screen size above will use the regular size of the spacer as defined in the block editor.

*Ratio* defines the amount of change. For example, 0.5 will halve the size, 2 will double it.


== Installation ==
## Settings Page
After activating the plugin, all spacers are automatically set to be halved on mobile. Visit the *Settings Page* to make updates to the default settings!

# Adjust Spacers On Mobile
A simple Wordpress Plugin that takes the every Wordpress Gutenberg Spacer Block and halves it on mobile

## Settings Page
*Breakpoint* configures the screen width in pixels when the spacers change size. This is the "max-width" for the mobile setting. Any screen size above will use the regular size of the spacer as defined in the block editor.

*Ratio* defines the amount of change. For example, 0.5 will halve the size, 2 will double it.
